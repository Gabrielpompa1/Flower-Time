# Unsolved problems / Major Hurdles
- I did not manage to make the word choices dynamic. I have plans on how to fix this, but I just ran out of time.
- One major hurdle and a proud moment for me was creating the makeUnderScore() function. When I typed it out and it worked, the moment the logic clicked I had felt I made the perfect function for what I was looking for and it felt great. The underscore issue gave me toruble for the first part of my assignment, and I made a good function that works dynamically.
- A second hurdle that I crossed, was designing the flower with CSS. I hadn't really worked with CSS shapes before but I figured it out and made something I am really proud of. It fits perfect with the design and the extra costumes were an added bonus.
